####### STEP 1 #######

# HL workload info

Before PCA + Clustering:
    removed responseCode, responeMessage, threadName, dataType, success, failureMessage, URL
    removed first row (ordered by Timestamp)

After distribution analysis:
    removed allThread (equal to grpThreads), idleTime (constant)

After PCA:
    choosed 5 PC

After Clustering:
    choosed 10 cluster


# LL data
Before PCA + Clustering:
    removed first row

After distribution analysis:
    removed swpd, si, so, st, gu

After PCA:
    choosed 8 PC

After Clustering:
    choosed 14 cluster

To characterize:
    just take one random sample for every cluster



####### STEP 2 #######

# HL syntetic
take the request with highest number for every cluster
- Cluster 1: HTTP medium_9
- Cluster 2: HTTP light_8
- Cluster 3: HTTP heavy_5
- Cluster 4: HTTP medium_8
- Cluster 5: HTTP medium_6
- Cluster 6: HTTP medium_10
- Cluster 7: HTTP light_3
- Cluster 8: HTTP heavy_4
- Cluster 9: HTTP heavy_3 (to use th group 2)
- Cluster 10: HTTP medium_7


####### STEP 3 #######

# Manipulate LLc (syntetic low level pca clustering)
note: 'wa' field has 0 deviation
applied same pca and clustering rules

took random sample (row) for every cluster



####### STEP 4 #######
## check if ll_subsed and ll_syntetic_subset are equivalent

follow the steps in the homework assignment pdf
used matlab script
USED alpha = 0.01

in our case data:
    not normally distrubuted (check both visually and ks test)
        unpaired observations:
            Wilcoxon rank-sum test on every column gives 0 
            (data from real and syntetic ll come from continuous distribution with equal medians)
