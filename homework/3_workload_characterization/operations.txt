####### STEP 1 #######

# HL workload info

Before PCA + Clustering:
    removed responseCode, responeMessage, threadName, dataType, success, failureMessage, URL
    removed first row (ordered by Timestamp)

After distribution analysis:
    removed allThread (equal to grpThreads), idleTime (constant)

After PCA:
    choosed 5 PC

After Clustering:
    choosed 10 cluster


# LL data
Before PCA + Clustering:
    removed first row

After distribution analysis:
    removed swpd, si, so, st, gu

After PCA:
    choosed 8 PC

After Clustering:
    choosed 14 cluster

To characterize:
    just take one random sample for every cluster



####### STEP 2 #######

# HL syntetic
take the request with highest number for every cluster
- Cluster 1: HTTP medium_9
- Cluster 2: HTTP light_8
- Cluster 3: HTTP heavy_5
- Cluster 5: HTTP medium_6
- Cluster 6: HTTP medium_10
- Cluster 7: HTTP light_3
- Cluster 8: HTTP heavy_4
- Cluster 9: HTTP heavy_2
- Cluster 10: HTTP medium_4
